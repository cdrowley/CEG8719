# CEG8719: Geospatial Data, Analytics and AI

Welcome to the repository of my initial submission for CEG8719. This project focuses on the acquisition and pre-processing of geospatial datasets and will be actively used through to the completion of my final MRes research paper in Summer 2024.

## Repository Overview
- **Jupyter Book Submission**: The actual submission of work (for Assignment 1 of CEG8719) is compiled and presented using Jupyter Book. This is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://cdrowley.github.io/CEG8719/).
- **Development Environment**: Codespaces is used to provide a consistent development environment for all work. This is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed via the `Code` button above and selecting `Open with Codespaces`.
- **Documentation**: Links and references to all datasets are documented within the Jupyter Book.
- **Open Source Datasets**: Hosted within this repository (subject to size constraints) in the `data` folder.
- **Proprietary Datasets**: These will only be accessible via private cloud storage, these are not hosted within this repository due to size constraints and licensing restrictions.

This book was created using a template from a [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/giswqs/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) template from [Qiusheng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vmml4_0AAAAJ). The cookiecutter book itself builds upon the excellent open source [Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book template](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book).
