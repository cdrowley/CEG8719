# CEG8719

This book, the initial submission for CEG3719: Geospatial Data, Analytics and AI, details my journey in acquiring and processing open-source datasets in Geospatial Data Science, serving as both a practical guide and a development environment for all subsequent open-source data work leading to my final MRes research paper in Summer 2024.

TODO: Add a link to the book here.
